# Preliminary studies

Consider your business requirements and find out

1. How the data should be delivered. Options:
   - [PostgreSQL](/howtos/postgres) with an optional [GraphQL API](/topics/graphql-api/) - can be real-time
   - [file-based dataset](/topics/store/file-store) - usually updates once every few hours
   - [custom store](/topics/store/custom-database)
2. What data should be delivered
3. What data should to be retrieved from blockchain
4. Whether you need to mix in any [off-chain data](/howtos/external-api)

**Example: NFT ownership**

Suppose you want to make a website that shows the image and ownership history for ERC721 NFTs from a certain contract.

For this application it makes sense to deliver data as a GraphQL API. Output data might have `Token`, `Owner` and `Transfer` entities, with e.g. `Token` supplying all the fields necessary to show ownership history and the image.

Data on token mints and ownership history can be derived from `Transfer(address,address,uint256)` events emitted by the contract. To render images, you'll also need to retrieve the off-chain token metadata (usually from IPFS).

**Example: DEX analytics**

Suppose you want to train an ML model from scratch on all trades done on Uniswap since the v3 upgrade.

A delay of few hours typically won't matter for this application, so you may want to deliver the data as files for easier handling. The output could be a simple list of swaps, listing pair, direction and token amounts for each.

All the required data is contained within `Swap` events emitted by pair pool contracts. Uniswap deploys these dynamically, so you will also have to capture `PoolCreated` events from the factory contract to know which `Swap` events are coming from Uniswap and map them to pairs. No off-chain data will be necessary for this task.
