# Before you begin

#### Why Subsquid?

The main benefit comes from Archives - data lakes that serve historical blockchain data much faster than possible with RPC. However, even when used without Archives it is a full fledged indexing framework that can retrieve, decode, transform and store blockchain data and, if necessary, serve it over a GraphQL API.

#### Can I use Subsquid with chain X?

A widget here that asks up to three questions

 - Is your network compatible with any of the following? \[EVM (*), Substrate, Neither\]
 - Do you have access to an RPC? \[Yes, No\]
 - Can you find your network in this list \[...evmOrSubstrateArchivesList, NOT LISTED\]

Depending on the answers some cards with options appear below: \[Archive-only squid, RPC-only squid, Hybrid squid, We cannot help you\]. The cards describe how much horsepower the squid will need from RPC and what latency you'll get.

\* [here](/reference/evm-indexing/rpc-calls) is exactly what we mean by EVM compatible

Missing: when does it make sense to query Archives directly

#### Can I get the data I need using Subsquid?

You can make arbitrary network requests within Subsquid indexers, including RPC calls, so yes. The real question is, will you be able to retrieve the historical portion of your data from Archives and benefit from their superior speed.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="evm" label="EVM" default>
```
[This page](/evm-indexing/supported-networks) lists Archives for Ethereum-compatible chains. Note that execution traces and state diffs are only available for select networks.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="substrate" label="Substrate">
```
See the [list of Archives](/dead) for Substrate-powered networks, such as Polkadot, Kusama and their parachains.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

There are very few tasks involving historical blockchain data where using Subsquid is not helpful. See [Limitations](/topics/limitations).

#### Where can I run Subsquid indexers?

On your own infrastructure or in a [Subsquid-managed cloud](/deploy-squid) that has a free tier.

#### Will I have to pay for using Archives?

No, Archives are funded by their supported networks.
