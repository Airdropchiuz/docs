# GraphQL Intro

GraphQL is an API query language, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a custom-defined type system. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine.

For more information, head over to the [official documentation website](https://graphql.org/learn/) and their extensive documentation, in this section we only cover the basics to work with the GraphQL API for the squid data, with short explanations of how to perform GraphQL queries, how to paginate and sort results.

At the moment, the GraphQL API is supported only for squids with a Postgres-based target database.
