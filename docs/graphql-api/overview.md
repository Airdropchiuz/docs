# GraphQL server

The data indexed by a squid into a Postgres database can be automatically presented with a GraphQL API service powered by the [OpenReader](https://github.com/subsquid/squid/tree/master/openreader) lib of the Squid SDK. The OpenReader GraphQL server takes [the schema file](/graphql-api/schema-file) as an input argument and serves a GraphQL API supporting [OpenCRUD](https://www.opencrud.org/) queries for the entities defined in the schema. 

To start the API server based on the `schema.graphql` run in the root folder:
```bash
npx squid-graphql-server
```
The `squid-graphql-server` binary supports multiple optional flags to enable e.g. caching, subscriptions, DoS protection, covered in the next sections.

The API server listens at port defined by `GQL_PORT` (default to `4350`). The database connection is configured with the env variables `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`.

The GraphQL API is enabled by the `api:` service in the `deploy` section of [squid.yaml](/deploy-squid/deploy-manifest) for Aquarium deployments.

## Supported Queries

The details of the supported OpenReader queries can be found in a separate section [Query a Squid](/graphql-api/query-squid). Here is a brief overview of the queries generated by OpenReader for each entity defined in the schema file:

- the squid last processed block is available with `squidStatus { height }` query 
- a "get one by ID" query with the name `{entityName}ById`
- a "get one" query for [`@unique` fields](/graphql-api/schema-file/indexes-and-constraints), with the name `{entityName}ByUniqueInput`
- [Relay-compatible cursor-based pagination](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm) queries for each entity, named `{entityName}sConnection`. Relay connection queries support filtering on each entity field with a `where` parameter, predicate compositions with `AND` and `OR` and limiting with `limit` parameters.
- (Deprecated in favor of Relay connections) Lookup queries with the name `{entityName}s`. 

Nested queries are supported out-of-the-box for entity relations:
- for the `one` side of a relation, `where` supports filtering on any field of the related entity
- for the `many` side of a relation, `where` supports filters `XXX_some`, `XXX_every` and `XXX_none` that match only if at least one (resp. each and none) of the related entities match the predicate.

[Union and typed JSON types](/graphql-api/schema-file/unions-and-typed-json) are mapped into [GraphQL Union Types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#union-types) with a proper type resolution with `__typename`.

## Built-in custom scalars

The OpenReader GraphQL API defines the following custom scalars in the GraphQL to present the corresponding entity fields:

- `DateTime`: `DateTime` fields in the schema are presented in the ISO format
- `Bytes`: `Bytes` fields are presented as hex-encoded strings prefixed with `0x`
- `BigInt`: `BigInt` fields are presented as strings
